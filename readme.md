# EP–133 K.O. II (ReactNative via Expo)

A Teenage Engineering-(ish) UI in Expo + Typescript (react-native). Not emitting any sounds.

Project uses:

- Typescript
- Expo fonts
- Expo aliases for @koii and @assets
- Reanimated3 + Gesture-Handler
- UseReducer for state
- React-native-svg for graphics as far as it goes + overlay texture images
